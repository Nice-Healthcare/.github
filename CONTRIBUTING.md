# Contributing

## Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to the project's [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Workflow

Many contributions to open source projects begins with a _fork_. Learn about [Contributing to projects](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) in the GitHub Docs. When you're ready to submit your changes, a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-a-pull-request) will be needed.

If you're looking to contribute bug fixes or new features, a good place to start is by reviewing or opening a new [Issue](../../issues). Proposed changes can be discussed prior to diving in to code.

### Submitting a bug or issue

Please ensure to include the following:

* A concise description of the bug or feature.
* Simple reproduction steps (in case of a bug), or Details of the need (in case of a feature).
* Contextual information (Platform, Environment, Version etc).

### Submitting a Pull Request

Please ensure to include the following in your Pull Request (PR):

* A description of what you are trying to do. (Linking to an issue would be great!)
* A description of the code changes.
* Documentation on how these changes are being tested.
* Additional tests to show your code working and to ensure future changes don't break your code.

Please keep your PRs to a minimal number of changes. If a PR is large, try to split it up into smaller PRs. Don't move code around unnecessarily as it makes comparing old with new very hard. If you have plans for a large change, please talk to the maintainers of the project beforehand. Where possible, any new feature should have tests that go along with it, to ensure it works, and will continue to work in the future. When a PR is submitted one of the prerequisites for it to be merged is that all tests pass.
